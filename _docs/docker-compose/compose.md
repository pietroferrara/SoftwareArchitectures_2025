## What we have seen so far
At this point, we know how to build a REST application and deploy it in a Docker container. However, we lack persistence: if we restart the application, all the inserted students will disappear.  
As we said in the docker lessons, this is not good. We now want to provide a way to add a database to store all the application data.  
To do this, we use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/6.3/">Hibernate</a>, a JPA (Java Persistence API) implementation.
## Docker Compose
We want to run the database server on a separate machine. This is because we don't want our database server to impact the performance of our application server directly. If our application demands more power in the future, we can scale the two servers independently. What we are going to see is a preliminary example of a distributed system. We have only one machine (our computer): we can simulate a distributed system using Docker Compose. The idea is to run our database in a separate container and link our application to the server. Docker compose can help us coordinate our containers' communication and life cycle.  
Docker compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. What we need to do is to create this YAML file inside our student application folder with the name compose.yaml:
{% highlight yaml %}
services:
  web:
    build: .
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - students_db
  students_db:
    volumes:
      - students-db:/var/lib/mysql
    image: "mysql:5.7"
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret_password
volumes:
  students-db:
{% endhighlight %}
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
The semantics of this file is relatively straightforward: We are creating two containers: one for our app (web) and another for our database (students_db).
The web container is exposed on port 8080 and depends on the database. This means that the app container must be started after the database to ensure that the database container is running.
The database stores its data in a volume (named students-db). It is based on MySQL version 5.7, exposes port 3306, and has an environment variable (MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD): in this variable, we put the root password (necessary to create the container).
With the command **docker compose up -d**, we start our multi-container application:
{% highlight bash %}
~/IdeaProjects/StudentsApp docker compose up -d

Let's check if everything is fine:
![HTTP intro]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dcjpa_compose_1.png)
To see our database in action, we can use a client like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dbeaver.io/">dbeaver</a> and try to test the connection to the server and the creation of a database: first thing to do is to create a new connection and download the mysql extension:
![HTTP intro]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dcjpa_compose_2.png)
Then, we can create a new connection:
![HTTP intro]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dcjpa_compose_3.png)
And test (for example, adding a database and a table):
![HTTP intro]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dcjpa_compose_4.png)
![HTTP intro]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dcjpa_compose_5.png)
Everything works! In the next section, we will see how to use Hibernate to connect our web application to the database.
